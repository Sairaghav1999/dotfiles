## Installation

The current approach is a little weird. You need to have Python 3.4+
environment with `click > 6` and `PyYAML` installed.

## Customization

You can do customization using `.local` files:

  - `~/.gitconfig.local`
      - This is sourced before any other files from this folder.
  - `~/.zshrc.local`
      - This is sourced before any other files from this folder.

These `.local` files can be used to add a few personal stuff without the need
to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you donâ€™t want to commit to
a public repository.

Make sure you create a `~/.gitconfig.local` for storing your credentials. Here's a template, if you're feeling lazy (replace everything in `{}` including the braces) :

```ini
[user]
    email = {your-email-id@example.com}
    name = {Your Name}

# Pro-tip: This makes working with sub-modules easier.
[url "git@github.com:{your-github-username-here}/"]
    insteadOf = "git://github.com/{your-github-username-here}/"
```

As things currently stand, these 2 files can modify nearly everything.
